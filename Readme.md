## Note

I give full credits to [Frontend Boilerplate](https://github.com/tj/frontend-boilerplate) where I got most of the code from. With my tweaks you will be able to develop easily on local using HMR and build static files and deploy straight to you single page hoster in my case it is Github Page.
